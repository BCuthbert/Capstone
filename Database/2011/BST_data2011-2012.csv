50196,INDIVIDUAL INVESTIGATION IN BIOSTATISTICS,BST,graduate standing and special approval.,,(repeatable for maximum 6 credits) Individual graduate investigation or research in areas related to biostatistics.,2011
52019,BIOSTATISTICS IN PUBLIC HEALTH ,BST,graduate standing.,,"Provides students with an understanding of basic statistical methods in public health research, as well as the skills to perform and interpret basic statistical procedures. Students learn how to use statistical analysis software to analyze real data from public health-related studies. They then learn how to interpret the analysis and present the results to public health professionals and educated lay audiences. Includes lab component which enhances student awareness and informed usage of SAS for public health analysis. Students learn how to input, read, store, export, and modify data in SAS and be able to use common SAS procedures to analyze public health data and conduct independent SAS programming.",2011
63012,SURVIVAL ANALYSIS IN PUBLIC HEALTH ,BST,BST 52019 and graduate standing.,,"Introduction in survival analysis for graduate students in public health. Covers survival functions, hazard rates, types of censoring and truncation. Methods of focus include life tables, Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank tests, Cox regression models and parametric survival models. Inference for recurrent event and competing risks models are also covered.",2011
63013,EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS IN PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH ,BST,BST 52019 and graduate standing.,,"Introduces students to experimental research methods, in public health settings. First introduces a number of quasi-experimental and experimental study designs, then identifies a number of statistical methods that can be used to draw correct causal inferences from the study. Students are expected to develop two research proposals, first using quasi-experimental then an experimental design and develop a statistical analysis plan for each study.",2011
63014,APPLIED REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC HEALTH DATA ,BST,BST 52019 and graduate standing.,,"Focuses on developing student proficiency in building and evaluating various regression models for public health studies. Topics covered include exploratory and descriptive methods, simple and multiple linear regression models, predictor selection, binary and multinomial logistic regression models, survival analysis, repeated measures and generalized linear models.",2011
63015,CATEGORICAL DATA ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC HEALTH DATA ,BST,BST 52019 and EPI 52017; and graduate standing.,,"Provides an applied introduction to the most important methods for analyzing categorical data in public health. Topics covered include contingency tables, logistic regression, generalized linear models, modeling matched pairs and clustered responses.",2011
73010,QUALITATIVE METHODS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH ,BST,doctoral standing.,,"Surveys major methods of qualitative research and explores issues and applications in public health, including integrating qualitative and quantitative methods. Approaches examined include: Ethnography; grounded theory; phenomenology; focus groups; narrative analysis; and Photo voice. Community-Based Participatory Research is explored as an approach for conducting qualitative research in public health.",2011
73011,MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS IN PUBLIC HEALTH ,BST,BST 52019 and doctoral standing.,,"Multivariate statistical methods are designed to evaluate more than one variable at a time. An application-oriented introduction to essential multivariate statistical methods used in public health. Topics covered include matrix theory, data screening and preliminary analyses, multivariate normal distributions, multivariate versions of the general linear model (MANOVA, multivariate multiple regression, MANCOVA), discrimination and classification, canonical correlation analysis, and methods of analyzing covariance and correlation structures (principal components and factor analysis). Also introduces and explores methods of handling missing data.",2011
