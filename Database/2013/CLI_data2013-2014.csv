80390,SIMULATED PATIENTS ROTATION ,CLI,tudent must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,,"The simulated patient lab offers third-year students experiences and feedback not available in other rotations. The use of simulated patients to train students in medical education began about 10-15 years ago and has gained acceptance at many medical schools in the United States and abroad. Simulated patients are actors who are coached to simulate an actual patient so accurately that a skilled clinician could not detect the simulation. In performing the simulation, the simulated patient presents the “gestalt” of the patient being simulated—not just the history, but the body language and personality characteristics as well. Properly trained simulated patients will not vary in the picture they present from student to student.
