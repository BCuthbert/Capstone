This course is coordinated with Human Anatomy and Cell and Tissue Biology.",2012
80124,LOWER EXTREMITY ANATOMY ,BSC,tudent must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,,"Lower extremity anatomy presents the detailed macroscopic anatomy of the lower limb. The course is augmented with radiographs, MRI, surface anatomy and cross sectional studies. The course includes an introduction to basic concepts of podiatric medicine, surgery and biomechanics. Laboratory instruction includes a detailed dissection of the lower limb, supplemented with computerized educational materials and study of natural bone specimens.",2012
80125,NEUROBIOLOGY ,BSC,Student must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,,"Neurobiology is the study of the structure and function of the nervous system. The course will deal with the anatomy, microscopic anatomy and physiology of the individual neurons and systems of neurons, which comprise the component parts of the nervous system. Topics will include sensory, special sensory and motor systems, the cerebral cortex, diencephalon, cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord. Discussions will include reference to clinical disorders related to those structures.",2012
80126,HUMAN SYSTEMS BIOLOGY ,BSC,tudent must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,,"The study of basic concepts of normal organ and organ system function, including body fluids and compartments, muscle physiology, cardiovascular physiology, renal function, respiration, gastrointestinal physiology and endocrinology. Emphasis is placed on the regulatory functions of each organ or system, as well as the contribution of each system to whole body homeostasis. The sequence of topics in this course are coordinated with those in GMD 121 Physical Assessment and Diagnosis.",2012
80128,MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY ,BSC,tudent must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,,"This course will introduce the student to the basic concepts, characteristics and techniques used in the study of the clinically significant microbic groups: viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. The structure, metabolism, genetics, control and laboratory techniques of each microbic group will be described. This course will also introduce the student to the molecular, cellular and organismal mechanisms responsible for the human immune response system. Laboratory will provide hands on experience in staining, cultivation, identification, sensitivity testing, and immunologic techniques.",2012
80218,HUMAN SYSTEMS PATHOLOGY ,BSC,tudent must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,,"The study of disease with emphasis on epidemiology, pathogenesis, natural history, morphologic appearance and relationship to clinical manifestation. Emphasis is placed on basic cellular pathologic processes (injury, inflammation and repair, neoplasia), and description of diseases organized by organ system. An introduction to the concepts of clinical decision making through the use of case studies and current clinical literature will be emphasized.",2012
80219,PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS ,BSC,tudent must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,,"Historically, the clinician was responsible for information about the sources, physical and chemical properties, compounding and dispensing of drugs. Today the practitioner’s responsibility requires the rational clinical use of therapeutic agents for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease based on an understanding of pharmacological principles. This course is designed to prepare practitioners to prescribe for maximum benefit and to recognize the clinical ramifications of concomitant drug therapy.",2012
