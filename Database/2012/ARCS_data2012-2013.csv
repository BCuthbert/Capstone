10121,REPRESENTATION OF DESIGN I ,ARCS,,,"A survey of the techniques and assumptions of basic architectural design concepts and representation of the built environment through analytical and synthetic exercises that introduce fundamental design skills. In order to integrate students into the college and the field, the exercises are supplemented by readings in contemporary visual culture.",2012
10122,REPRESENTATION OF DESIGN II ,ARCS,ARCS 10121 or ARCH 10101.,,"Continuation of ARCS 10121 with an emphasis on 3-D thinking and representation, critical skills and the role of images in architectural culture and society. The course also introduces the wider application of design principles in graphic design, digital media and the visualization of information.",2012
20121,STUDIO FOR ARCHITECTURAL STUDIES ,ARCS,ARCS 10122 or ARCH 10102.,,"An introduction to basic issues in architectural design and composition. Through sketch projects and design exercises in a variety of media, students gain a familiarity with basic architectural problems and the kinds of thinking architects use to address those problems.",2012
20122,STUDIO FOR ARCHITECTURAL STUDIES II ,ARCS,ARCS 20121 or ARCH 20101.,,Studio allows students to further develop their design skills in relation to a theme or shared research topic that crosses the disciplinary boundaries of architecture and challenges conventional ideas of the role design can play in developing knowledge.,2012
30022,URBAN DESIGN DISCOURSE ,ARCS,ARCH 45203.,,"Starting in the 1960s, a series of theorist attempted to understand the city as a form of writing, producing some of the most influential design books of the last generation. Course investigates this literature, using a range of writing exercises in which students interpret both urban space and the writing it inspires.",2012
30123,MATERIALS AND PROCESS OF MAKING ,ARCS,AED 10001 and 10002 and 10101 and 10102; and architectural studies (ARCS) major.,,"Seeks to introduce and foster an ease of mobility through various digital design environments utilizing familiar techniques of design production (i.e. drawing, modeling, rendering, etc.). Students engage in digital modes of production that will enable the testing of material, spatial, and tectonic performance through scalar prototyping.",2012
30124,METHODS AND THEORIES OF REPRESENTATION ,ARCS,AED 10001 and 10002 and 10101 and 10102; and architectural studies (ARCS) major.,,Seeks to examine traditional and contemporary methods of architectural representation as generative tools that mediate between individual idea and constructed environment.,2012
30321,STRUCTURAL TYPOLOGY ,ARCS,ARCS 10121.,,"Course provides a non-computational introduction to structural principles, materials and building technologies. Historical and contemporary examples are used as case studies. The goal of the course is to give students an understanding of the role structural engineering and materials science play in design thinking and how they can drive design innovation.",2012
30421,THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPERATIVE ,ARCS,ARCS 10121.,,Course begins with a historical introduction to the transformative role played by environmental technologies in modern architecture. This discussion is then brought into the present through an introduction to a wide range of contemporary thinking about sustainability in architecture and urbanism.,2012
40114,THEORY AND CRITICISM IN ARCHITECTURAL MEDIA ,ARCS,architectural studies (ARCS) major; and junior or senior standing.,,Aimed at investigating the increasingly intertwined issues that link contemporary architectural theory and criticism with the world of media.,2012
