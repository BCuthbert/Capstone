",None,"The focus of the medical ethics curriculum is to provide a foundation in ethical analysis, augment knowledge of
contemporary bioethics issues, and offer experience applying ethical reasoning to clinical cases. The goal of this
course is to promote discussion of the ethical responsibilities of a doctor to their patients."
PMD 80114 ,"PRINCIPLES OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
",PMD,enrolled in the College of Podiatric Medicine.,None,"It is important for a podiatric physician to have developed the ability to read and interpret the medical literature.
This requires a fundamental understanding of biostatistics, epidemiology, and research design. This course
provides a framework for the development of an evidence-based methodology to patient care."

PMD 80132 ,"LOW EXTREMITY ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS
",PMD,"enrolled in the College ofPodiatric Medicine. 
",None,"A comprehensive approach to physical examination, which combines the patient’s symptoms and the physical
signs to arrive at a diagnosis of disease. It is accomplished by training students in the methods of history taking
and physical examination. The course focuses on lower extremity examination. The traditional processes of
inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation are emphasized."
PMD 80133 ,"INTRODUCTION MEDICAL IMAGING
",PMD,student must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,None,"Podiatric physicians are fully licensed to order, perform and interpret radiologic studies of the foot and ankle. As
operators of ionizing x-ray equipment, all practitioners must undergo basic training in x-ray physics, image
control and quality assurance, safety and patient positioning. These four building blocks comprise the foundation
of this course in fundamentals."
PMD 80134 ,"RADIATION SAFETY
",PMD,enrolled in the College of Podiatric Medicine.,None,"Podiatric physicians are fully licensed to order, perform and interpret radiologic studies of the foot and ankle. As

control and quality assurance, safety and patient positioning. These four building blocks comprise the foundation
of this course in fundamentals."
PMD 80211 ,"PODIATRIC MEDICINE I
",PMD,enrolled in the College of Podiatric Medicine.,None,"This is a core course designed to present the 2nd year student with the full spectrum of pathology, which he or
she will encounter during his or her clinical training and later in private practice. Topics include infectious
disease, wound care, rheumatology, vascular medicine, and the diabetic foot. The student will be instructed in
the evaluation of foot and ankle pathology including signs, symptoms, and differential diagnosis. Laboratory and
radiographic evaluation will be discussed when appropriate. The student will also be instructed in the treatment
alternatives available in each case."
PMD 80214 ,"RADIOLOGY AND MEDICAL IMAGING I
",PMD,"enrolled in the College of PodiatricMedicine. 
",None,"This course encompasses the fundamentals of modern musculoskeletal imaging, with particular emphasis on the
foot and ankle. The course begins with basic principles of plain film radiographic imaging, an approach that
emphasizes the correlation of abnormal findings with basis pathologic differential consideration. Lectures will
then introduce the student to pedal biomechanical radiography before moving to cover the imaging topics such
as the pedal arthropathies, infection and the diabetic foot. The semester will end with a detailed presentation of
the diabetic neuro-osteoarthropathy (Charcot arthropathy)."
PMD 80215 ,"PODIATRIC MEDICAL PRACTICE SEMINAR
",PMD,enrolled in the College of Podiatric Medicine.,None,"Through instruction by numerous field experts of the American Academy of Podiatric Practice Management, this
monthly class is designed to facilitate the long term objective of optimizing the academic knowledge obtained
throughout the first two years and prepares the student to become an outstanding “caregiver.” The core focus
includes communication skills, patient compliance, dealing with conflicts, concepts of efficiency, and practice
model options."

PMD 80221 ,"PODIATRIC MEDICINE II
",PMD,enrolled in the College of Podiatric Medicine.,None,"This is a core course designed to present the 2nd year student with the full spectrum of pathology, which he or
she will encounter during his or her clinical training and later in private practice. Topics include infectious
disease, wound care, peripheral neuropathy, vascular medicine, and the diabetic foot. The student will be
instructed in the evaluation of foot and ankle pathology including signs, symptoms, and differential diagnosis.
Laboratory and radiographic evaluation will be discussed when appropriate. The student will also be instructed in
the treatment alternatives available in each case."
PMD 80222 ,"PODIATRIC MEDICAL SKILLS
",PMD,enrolled in the College of Podiatric Medicine.,None,"Podiatric Medical Skills is a practical course, which includes strapping and padding, instrument dexterity, local
anesthetic injection, nail avulsion technique, blood glucose finger stick, handheld Doppler exam, fitting for
diabetic shoes, arthrometric examination and casting for orthoses. Students are taught the indications and
proper application of adhesive bandages and splints for the prevention of injury, control of foot function and
treatment of injuries to the foot and lower extremity. Padding is the treatment of foot pathology by
redistribution of weight, stress and friction. Students are taught how to relieve acute and chronic pathologies of
the foot through the use of various padding materials, or prefabricated pads. Students also gain an
understanding of the theory of pad placement. Students are taught the proper techniques for performing toenail
avulsions, blood glucose finger sticks, and using the handheld Doppler. Students are taught the proper methods
of fitting for diabetic shoes, performing a foot and ankle arthrometric examination and casting methods for foot
orthoses."
PMD 80224 ,"RADIOLOGY AND MEDICAL IMAGING II
",PMD,enrolled in the College of Podiatric Medicine.,None,"The Spring semester course will continue to the topic of imaging complex diabetic foot problems, focusing on
non-invasive imaging modalities as potential problem solvers. The first of these will be radionuclide imaging
modalities, which will be covered in detail. From the diabetic foot, the course will then logically continue onto
defining and then detailing the classic metabolic bone disorders. The course will then delve into the basics of MR
and CT sectional imaging. The course will then formally cover applications to common pedal problems such as
infection, trauma, and bone and soft tissue tumors. The course will then conclude with an introduction to
diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound."
