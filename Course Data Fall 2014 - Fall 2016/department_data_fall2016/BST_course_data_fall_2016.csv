BST 50196 ,"INDIVIDUAL INVESTIGATION IN BIOSTATISTICS
",BST,graduate standing and special approval.,None,"(repeatable for maximum 6 credits) Individual graduate investigation or research in areas related to
biostatistics."
BST 52019 ,"BIOSTATISTICS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
",BST,graduate standing.,None,"Provides students with an understanding of basic statistical methods in public health research, as well as the
skills to perform and interpret basic statistical procedures. Students learn how to use statistical analysis software
to analyze real data from public health-related studies. They then learn how to interpret the analysis and
present the results to public health professionals and educated lay audiences. Includes lab component which
enhances student awareness and informed usage of SAS for public health analysis. Students learn how to input,
read, store, export, and modify data in SAS and be able to use common SAS procedures to analyze public health
data and conduct independent SAS programming."
BST 60191 ,"VARIABLE CONTENT SEMINAR IN BIOSTATISTICS
",BST,Graduate standing.,None,"(Repeatable for credit) Seminar on current and important topics in biostatistics. Subject matter varies depending
on the topic."
BST 60192 ,"PRACTICUM EXPERIENCE IN BIOSTATISTICS
",BST,graduate standing and special approval.,None,"Observational and participation in public health activities of a public health agency, hospital or other approved
organization. The student completes the field experience with joint supervision from the university and approved
organization or agency."
BST 60195 ,"SPECIAL TOPICS IN BIOSTATISTICS
",BST,Graduate standing.,None,(Repeatable for a maximum of 6 credit hours) Special topics to sample new offerings on topics in biostatistics.
BST 63012 ,"SURVIVAL ANALYSIS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
",BST,BST 52019 and 63014; and graduate standing.,None,"Introduction in survival analysis for graduate students in public health. Covers survival functions, hazard rates,
types of censoring and truncation. Methods of focus include life tables, Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank tests, Cox
regression models and parametric survival models. Inference for recurrent event and competing risks models
are also covered."
BST 63013 ,"EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS IN PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH
",BST,"BST 52019 and 63014; and graduatestanding. 
",None,"Introduces students to experimental research methods, in public health settings. First introduces a number of
quasi-experimental and experimental study designs, then identifies a number of statistical methods that can be
used to draw correct causal inferences from the study."
BST 63014 ,"APPLIED REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC HEALTH DATA
",BST,"BST 52019 and graduatestanding. 
",None,"(Cross-listed with BST 83014) Focuses on developing student proficiency in building and evaluating various
regression models for public health studies. Topics covered include exploratory and descriptive methods, simple
and multiple linear regression models, predictor selection, binary and multinomial logistic regression models,
survival analysis, repeated measures and generalized linear models."
BST 63015 ,"CATEGORICAL DATA ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC HEALTH DATA
",BST,"BST 52019 and EPI 52017; andgraduate standing. 
",None,"(Cross-listed with BST 83015) Provides an applied introduction to the most important methods for analyzing
categorical data in public health. Topics covered include contingency tables, logistic regression, generalized
linear models, modeling matched pairs and clustered responses."
BST 73010 ,"QUALITATIVE METHODS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH
",BST,doctoral standing.,None,"Surveys major methods of qualitative research and explores issues and applications in public health, including
integrating qualitative and quantitative methods. Approaches examined include: Ethnography; grounded theory;
phenomenology; focus groups; narrative analysis; and Photovoice. Community-Based Participatory Research is
explored as an approach for conducting qualitative research in public health."
BST 73011 ,"MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
",BST,BST 52019 and doctoral standing.,None,"Multivariate statistical methods are designed to evaluate more than one variable at a time. An application-
oriented introduction to essential multivariate statistical methods used in public health. Topics covered include
matrix theory, data screening and preliminary analyses, multivariate normal distributions, multivariate versions
of the general linear model (MANOVA, multivariate multiple regression, MANCOVA), discrimination and
classification, canonical correlation analysis, and methods of analyzing covariance and correlation structures
(principal components and factor analysis). Also introduces and explores methods of handling missing data."
BST 83012 ,"SURVIVAL ANALYSIS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
",BST,"BST 52019; and BST 63014 or83014; and doctoral standing. 
",None,"Covers survival functions, hazard rates, types of censoring and truncation. Methods of focus include life tables,
Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank tests, Cox regression models and parametric survival models. Inference for
recurrent event and competing risks models are also covered."
BST 83013 ,"EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS IN PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH
",BST,BST 52019; and BST 63014 or 83014; and doctoral standing.,None,"Designed to introduce students to experimental research methods, in public health settings. First introduces a
number of quasi-experimental and experimental study designs, then identifies a number of statistical methods
that can be used to draw correct causal inferences from the study. Students are expected to develop two
research proposals, first using quasi-experimental then an experimental design and develop a statistical analysis
plan for each study."
BST 83014 ,"APPLIED REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC HEALTH DATA
",BST,"BST 52019 and doctoralstanding. 
",None,"(Cross-listed with BST 63014) Focuses on developing student proficiency in building and evaluating various
