ARCS 10121 ,"REPRESENTATION OF DESIGN I
",ARCS,none.,None,"A survey of the techniques and assumptions of basic architectural design concepts and representation of the
built environment through analytical and synthetic exercises that introduce fundamental design skills. In order to
integrate students into the college and the field, the exercises are supplemented by readings in contemporary
visual culture."
ARCS 10122 ,"REPRESENTATION OF DESIGN II
",ARCS,ARCS 10121 or ARCH 10101.,None,"Continuation of ARCS 10121 with an emphasis on 3-D thinking and representation,critical skills and the role of
images in architectural culture and society. The course also introduces the wider application of design principles
in graphic design, digital media and the visualization of information."
ARCS 20121 ,"STUDIO FOR ARCHITECTURAL STUDIES
",ARCS,"AED 10102; andArchitectural Studies (ARCS) major. 
",None,"Course exposes students to the distinct design processes, final products, and interconnectedness of various
allied design disciplines including (but not limited to) graphic design, interior design, landscape architecture,
urban design, industrial design, architecture and historic preservation."
ARCS 20122 ,"STUDIO FOR ARCHITECTURAL STUDIES II
",ARCS,ARCS 20121 or ARCH 20101.,None,"Studio allows students to further develop their design skills in relation to a theme or shared research topic that
crosses the disciplinary boundaries of architecture and challenges conventional ideas of the role design can play
in developing knowledge."
ARCS 30123 ,"MATERIALS AND PROCESS OF MAKING
",ARCS,AED 10102; and architectural studies (ARCS) major.,None,"Seeks to introduce and foster an ease of mobility through various digital design environments utilizing familiar
techniques of design production (i.e. drawing, modeling, rendering, etc.). Students engage in digital modes of
production that will enable the testing of material, spatial, and tectonic performance through scalar prototyping."
ARCS 30124 ,"METHODS AND THEORIES OF REPRESENTATION
",ARCS,"AED 10102; and architecturalstudies (ARCS) major. 
",None,"Seeks to examine traditional and contemporary methods of architectural representation as generative tools that
mediate between individual idea and constructed environment."
ARCS 30321 ,"STRUCTURAL TYPOLOGY
",ARCS,"AED 10102 or ARCH 10012; andarchitectural studies (ARCS) major or minor. 
",None,"Course provides a non-computational introduction to structures that focuses on: structure as organization, the
historical development of structural prototypes, the structural properties of materials. Utilizes lab exercises to
introduce students to basic structural principles and to discuss the effect of scientific method, structural
engineering and materials science on architectural design."
ARCS 30421 ,"ENVIRONMENTAL IMPERATIVES
",ARCS,"AED 10102 or ARCH 10012; and architectural studies (ARCS) major orminor. 
",None,"Course introduces students to various viewpoints on sustainable built environments with emphasis on the
ethical, ecological, social, political, economic, and technical implications. Engages students in debates on
theoretical and practical positions on sustainability, and the organizations that support sustainable practices in
the building industry."
ARCS 40022 ,"URBAN DESIGN DISCOURSE
",ARCS,ARCH 45213; and architectural studies (ARCS) major or minor.,None,"Course explores the interconnections among making space, image creation and inhabiting the city; engages
students in visual and textual documentation of urban life and phenomena. Course presents history, theory and
practices of documentation in conjunction with investigation of, and frequent visits to, Cleveland sites as the
basis for student projects."
ARCS 40114 ,"THEORY AND CRITICISM IN ARCHITECTURAL MEDIA
",ARCS,ARCH 45213; and architectural studies (ARCS) major or minor.,None,"Aimed at investigating the increasingly intertwined issues that link contemporary architectural theory and
criticism with the world of media."
