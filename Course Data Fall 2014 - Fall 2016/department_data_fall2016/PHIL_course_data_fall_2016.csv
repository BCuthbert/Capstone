PHIL 11001 ,"INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY
",PHIL,None.,None,"An introduction to the diverse methods and subject matters in philosophy. Topics may include: What are the
arguments for the existence of God? Do humans have free will? Can we know anything with certainty, and how
do we know anything at all? Is what we see real, or might it be only an illusion? What makes a person a person -
their mind, or their physical attributes? Is the mind the brain, or is it something else?"
PHIL 11009 ,"CRITICAL THINKING
",PHIL,None.,None,"Critical thinking is essential to every aspect of life, whether reading a news report or editorial, examining a
contract or other legal document, or entering into a debate. This course teaches the strategies of “cognitive self-
defense” that allow students to see past false claims and avoid being deceived by misleading rhetorical
strategies. The course also examines the role of argument in reasoning, including types of arguments and the
ways in which mistakes in reasoning can lead us astray. Examples from everyday life illustrate the sorts of
complex reasoning that are a crucial part of practical decision-making."
PHIL 21001 ,"INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS
",PHIL,None.,None,"What makes an action morally right or morally wrong, and who gets to decide? Is ethics about performing
actions that are morally right, or is it about being a virtuous person? This course examines at least three
competing theories about ethics, including challenges to each theory. Students get to decide which theory they
think is best, but every theory presents its own strengths and weaknesses."
PHIL 21002 ,"INTRODUCTION TO FORMAL LOGIC
",PHIL,"MATH 00022with a minimum C grade or minimum 22 ACT mathematics score or minimum 520 SAT mathematics score or
minimum 35 ALEKS placement exam score. 
",None,"This course is designed to sharpen students' reasoning skills and to help them better understand the structure of
reasoning in general. To do this, it introduces students to some formal languages, such as Propositional Logic
and Predicate Logic, that represent the logical structure of deductive reasoning. Unlike natural languages such
as English, these formal languages allow us to focus on the general structure of different types of arguments,
without discussing the content of any particular argument. This course covers both the construction of formal
proofs in these languages, and translation between them and English. The study of formal logic contributes to
effective and persuasive reasoning, not only in philosophy, but in any discipline or context. It also provides
effective tools for evaluating the strength of English-language arguments. The skills that students acquire in this
course are thus widely applicable in their personal, professional, and academic lives."
