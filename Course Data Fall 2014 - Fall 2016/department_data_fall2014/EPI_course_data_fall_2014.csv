various epidemiologic study designs including cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies. Reviews
statistical concepts and epidemiologic studies designs, outlines a strategy for data analysis and reviews
relevant methodologic issues and applies stratified analysis methods and multivariable regression models to
the studies. Develops an understanding of the underlying principles and assumptions, practical application,
and correct interpretation of the epidemiologic results. Provides hands on experience on the application of
epidemiologic analysis methods and presentation of the results."

Focuses primarily on application of the various statistical models covered, with direct application illustrated
using standard statistical software. Topics covered include univariate and multivariate analysis of variance for
repeated measures, mixed-effects models (HLM or multilevel models), covariance pattern models, generalized
estimating equations (GEE), mixed-effects logistic regression models and missing data in longitudinal studies."

chronic disease epidemiology. Putative factors and infectious agents are examined as causes of chronic
disease and chronic syndromes. Issues related to screening and surveillance will be understood. Students
