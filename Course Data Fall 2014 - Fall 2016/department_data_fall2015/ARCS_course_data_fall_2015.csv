ARCS 10121 ,"REPRESENTATION OF DESIGN I
",ARCS,none.,None,"A survey of the techniques and assumptions of basic architectural design
concepts and representation of the
 built environment through analytical
and synthetic exercises that introduce fundamental design skills. In order
 to integrate students into the college and the field, the exercises are supplemented by readings in
 contemporary visual culture."
ARCS 10122 ,"REPRESENTATION OF DESIGN II
",ARCS,ARCS 10121 or ARCH 10101.,None,"Continuation of ARCS 10121 with an emphasis on 3-D thinking and representation,critical skills and the role of
 images in architectural culture and society. The course also introduces the wider application of
design principles
 in graphic design, digital media and the visualization of information."
ARCS 20121 ,"STUDIO FOR ARCHITECTURAL STUDIES
",ARCS,"ARCS 10122 or AED 10102; and ArchitecturalStudies (ARCS) major.
",None,"An introduction to basic issues in architectural design and composition.
Through sketch projects and design
 exercises in a variety of media, students gain a familiarity with basic architectural problems and the kinds of
 thinking architects use to address those problems."
ARCS 20122 ,"STUDIO FOR ARCHITECTURAL STUDIES II
",ARCS,ARCS 20121 or ARCH 20101.,None,"Studio allows students to further develop their design skills in relation to a theme or shared research topic that
 crosses the disciplinary boundaries of architecture and challenges conventional ideas of the role design can play
 in developing knowledge."
ARCS 30022 ,"URBAN DESIGN DISCOURSE
",ARCS,"ARCH20113 or AED
10102; and Architectural Studies (ARCS) major or minor.
",None,"Starting in the 1960s, a series of theorist attempted to understand the city as a form of writing, producing some
 of the most influential design
books of the last generation. Course investigates this literature, using a range of
 writing exercises in which students interpret both urban space and the writing it inspires."
ARCS 30123 ,"MATERIALS AND PROCESS OF MAKING
",ARCS,AED 10002; and architectural studies (ARCS) major or minor.,None,"Seeks to introduce and foster an ease of mobility through various digital design environments utilizing familiar
 techniques of design production (i.e. drawing, modeling, rendering, etc.). Students engage in
digital modes of
 production that will enable the testing of material, spatial, and tectonic performance through scalar prototyping."
ARCS 30124 ,"METHODS AND THEORIES OF REPRESENTATION
",ARCS,"AED 10002; and architecturalstudies (ARCS) major or minor.
",None,"Seeks to examine traditional and contemporary methods of architectural representation as generative tools that
 mediate between individual idea and constructed environment."
ARCS 30321 ,"STRUCTURAL TYPOLOGY
",ARCS,AED 10002; and architectural studies (ARCS) major or minor.,None,"Course provides a non-computational introduction to structural principles, materials and building technologies.
 Historical and contemporary examples are used as case studies. The goal of the course is to give students an
 understanding of the role structural engineering and materials science play in design thinking and how they can
 drive design innovation."
ARCS 30421 ,"THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPERATIVE
",ARCS,"AED 10002; or specialpermission by both the instructor and program coordinator.
",None,"Course begins with a historical introduction to the transformative role played by environmental technologies in
 modern architecture. This discussion is then brought into the present through an introduction to a
wide range of
 contemporary thinking about sustainability in architecture and urbanism."
ARCS 40114 ,"THEORY AND CRITICISM IN ARCHITECTURAL MEDIA
",ARCS,"AED 10002; and architectural studies (ARCS) major; and junioror senior standing.
",None,"Aimed at investigating the increasingly intertwined issues that link contemporary architectural theory and
 criticism with the world of media."
