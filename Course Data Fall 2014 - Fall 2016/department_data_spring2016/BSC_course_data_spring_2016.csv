Course Number,Course Name,Department,Prerequisites,Corequesites,Description
BSC 80111 ,"HUMAN ANATOMY
",BSC,student must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicne program.,None,"The macroscopic anatomy of the upper limb, thorax, abdomen, head and neck, pelvis and perineum of the
 human body is described, utilizing audiovisual teaching aids and full cadaver dissection. The course is taught
 using a regional approach, with emphasis on structural and functional relationships. The laboratory instruction
 includes cadaver dissection supplemented with anatomical prosections, as well as cross-sectional anatomy and
 computerized educational material."
BSC 80112 ,"HUMAN CELL AND TISSUE BIOLOGY
",BSC,"student must be enrolled in thePodiatric Medicine program.
",None,"Histology is the study of the microscopic organization of the human body. Reciprocal relationships between
 normal structural features and their functions are emphasized. Macromolecules, organelles, cells, fundamental
 body tissues and organs are compared and contrasted. Light microscopic preparations are examined in
 laboratories, which are closely
correlated with lecture topics."
BSC 80113 ,"MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
",BSC,student must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,None,"The study of the physical and chemical properties of the major constituents of cells and body fluids. This
 includes structures, functions and biochemical mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis, utilization and
 degradation of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Also included are enzyme kinetics,
 bioenergetics, cellular communication, nutrition and biochemistry of specialized tissues and fluids."
BSC 80114 ,"MEDICAL GENETICS AND EMBRYOLOGY
",BSC,student must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,None,"This course will include the basic principles of human genetics dealing with the genetic variations that impact
 medical practice. Molecular genetics, cytogenetics, genomics, and population genetics will be reviewed. This
 course will also review the major events and processes involved in normal and abnormal embryologic
 development of the major body organs and systems. This course is coordinated with Human Anatomy and Cell
 and Tissue Biology."
BSC 80124 ,"LOWER EXTREMITY ANATOMY
",BSC,student must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,None,"Lower extremity anatomy presents the detailed macroscopic anatomy of the
lower limb. The course is
 augmented with radiographs, MRI, surface anatomy and cross sectional studies. The course includes an
 introduction
to basic concepts of podiatric medicine, surgery and biomechanics. Laboratory instruction includes
 a detailed dissection of the lower limb,
supplemented with computerized educational materials and study of
natural bone specimens."
BSC 80125 ,"NEUROBIOLOGY
",BSC,"Student must be enrolled in the PodiatricMedicine program.
",None,"Neurobiology is the study of the structure and function of the nervous system. The course will deal with the
 anatomy, microscopic anatomy and physiology of the individual neurons and systems of neurons, which
2015 Kent State University Catalog - Spring 2016 Course Descriptions
comprise the component parts of the nervous system. Topics will include sensory, special sensory and motor
 systems, the cerebral cortex, diencephalon, cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord. Discussions will include
 reference to clinical disorders related to those structures."
BSC 80126 ,"HUMAN SYSTEMS BIOLOGY
",BSC,"student must be enrolledin the Podiatric Medicine program.
",None,"The study of basic concepts of normal organ and organ system function, including body fluids and
 compartments, muscle physiology, cardiovascular physiology, renal function, respiration, gastrointestinal
 physiology and endocrinology. Emphasis is placed on the regulatory functions of each organ or system, as well
 as the contribution of each system to whole body homeostasis. The sequence of topics in this course are
 coordinated with those in GMD 121 Physical Assessment and Diagnosis."
BSC 80128 ,"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY
",BSC,"student must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicineprogram.
",None,"This course will introduce the student to the basic concepts, characteristics and techniques used in the study of
 the clinically significant microbic groups: viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. The
structure, metabolism,
 genetics, control and laboratory techniques of each microbic group will be described. The roles and outcomes of
 these organisms in producing manifestations of human infection and disease will be investigated. This course
 will also introduce the student to the
molecular, cellular and organismal mechanisms responsible for the human
 immune response system. Laboratory will provide hands on experience in staining, cultivation, identification,
 sensitivity testing, and immunologic techniques."
BSC 80218 ,"HUMAN SYSTEMS PATHOLOGY
",BSC,student must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,None,"The study of disease with emphasis on epidemiology, pathogenesis, natural history, morphologic appearance
 and relationship to clinical manifestation. Emphasis is placed on basic cellular pathologic processes
(injury,
 inflammation and repair, neoplasia), and description of diseases organized by organ system. An introduction to
 the concepts of clinical decision making through the use of case studies and current clinical literature will be
 emphasized."
BSC 80219 ,"PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS
",BSC,"student must be enrolledin the Podiatric Medicine program.
",None,"Historically, the clinician was responsible for information about the sources, physical and chemical properties,
 compounding and dispensing of
drugs. Today the practitioner’s responsibility requires the rational clinical use of
 therapeutic agents for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease based on an understanding of
pharmacological principles. This course is designed to prepare practitioners to prescribe for maximum benefit
 and to recognize the clinical ramifications of concomitant drug therapy."
BSC 80228 ,"HUMAN SYSTEMS PATHOLOGY
