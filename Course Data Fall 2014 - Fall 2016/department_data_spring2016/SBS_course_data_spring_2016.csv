SBS 50002 ,"QUANTITATIVE METHODS IN SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
",SBS,"BST 52019; and graduatestanding.
",None,"Introduces basic quantitative methods used in social and behavioral scientific research. First we focus on the
 measurement of socio-behavioral phenomena and the relationship between measurement and statistics. Next,
 we examine the interrelated roles of scientific theory
and the design of socio-behavioral research studies. Last,
 we focus on building appropriate multiple linear regression andor analysis of variance statistical models to
 provide valid analysis of data collected in socio-behavioral research."
SBS 50020 ,"SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE THEORIES
",SBS,graduate standing.,None,"Examines fundamental social and behavioral science theoretical frameworks that explain health behaviors with
 an emphasis on application
through universal prevention approaches to inform both research and program
 evaluation designs."
SBS 50030 ,"SEMINAR IN SOCIAL AND BEHAVIOR SCIENCES
",SBS,graduate standing.,None,"Explores case studies in the social and behavioral sciences on topics that address the leading health indicators
 including substance use (alcohol, tobacco and other drugs), obesity (physical activity and nutrition), HIV and
 STIs, mental health, injury, immunization and access
to health care, and social determinants of health."
SBS 50196 ,"INDIVIDUAL INVESTIGATION IN SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
",SBS,"graduatestanding and special approval.

 sciences."
SBS 53008 ,"GRANT WRITING IN SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
",SBS,graduate standing.,None,"2015 Kent State University Catalog - Spring 2016 Course Descriptions
Students learn the basics of grant writing for federal and non-federal funding agencies with a particular
 emphasis on the components of most proposals for funding. This includes rationale for seeking funds,
collaborations with community organizations, and working with consultants and subcontractors. Participants
 also learn about the basic sections of grant writing such as specific aims and hypotheses, developing a literature
 review, background and significance, research design and methodology, developing a budget and conducting
 research with
human subjects. Participants have an opportunity to write sample grant proposals, learn about
 the review and scoring process and post-award grant management."
SBS 54634 ,"SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH BEHAVIORS
",SBS,"graduatestanding.
",None,"Overviews the social determinants of health and the dynamic interplay between individual behaviors and
 community structures (systems orientation) including public policy, social and built environments, commercial
 messages, access to services, cultural norms, psychosocial hazards, and poverty both as causal effects that
 either provide opportunity or constraints to health. Also examines systems approaches to preventing public
 health threats from issues including substance use (alcohol, tobacco and other drugs), physical inactivity, poor
 dietary practices, unsafe sexual behaviors, violence and injury, and mental health."

 systematic inquiry on health behaviors including substance use (alcohol, tobacco and other drugs), physical
 activity, dietary practices, mental health, violence and injury, and sexual behaviors."
SBS 73019 ,"THEORIES OF PREVENTION SCIENCE II
