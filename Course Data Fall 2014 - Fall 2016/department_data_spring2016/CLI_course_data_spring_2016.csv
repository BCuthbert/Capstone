directly observe patient care at the
 Cleveland Foot and Ankle Institute. During the course of patient care students will assist in the

 members. Students interact with other students, staff, residents and clinicians. It is important during the course
 of patient care that the student understands
the patient’s concerns, complaints, psychosocial status, past
medical history and medications. Students also develop good patient communication skills. The student should
 use this opportunity as a guide
to become professional and ethical podiatric physicians."
CLI 80200 ,"STANDARDIZED PATIENTS ROTATION
",CLI,"student must be enrolled2015 Kent State University Catalog - Spring 2016 Course Descriptions
in the Podiatric Medicine program.
",None,"Offers second year students the opportunity to interview standardized patients and receive feedback on their
 patient interviewing and history recording ski8lls which prepares them to function competently in a
doctor/patient encounter. Some students find that interviewing patients comes naturally, while for others it is
 more a learned skill. The standardized patients are actors who have been coached to simulate actual patients so
 accurately that the simulation could possibly fool even a skilled clinician."
CLI 80201 ,"INTRODUCTION TO PATIENT CARE II
",CLI,student must be enrolled in the Podiatric Medicine program.,None,"This clinical rotation provides the second year student to directly observe patient care at the Cleveland Foot and

 diagnoses, diagnosis, treatment and future plans for the patient. Students develop good patient communication
 skills. The student should use this opportunity as a guide to become a professional and ethical podiatric
 physician."
CLI 80310 ,"PODIATRIC SURGERY ROTATION
",CLI,"student must be enrolled in the PodiatricMedicine program.
",None,"Stresses complete pre-operative and post-operative management of the surgical patient. Many foot deformities
 can be corrected with surgery. Work up for the purposes of establishing proper diagnosis, selection of
appropriate surgical procedure and designing a proper follow-up plan are
necessary components of successful
 surgical outcome. Proper post-operative patient care as well as early recognition of potential surgical
 complications are stressed. These are essential to a successful
surgical practice. While the scope of surgery
 varies greatly with differences in postgraduate training, there exists a basic core of knowledge and various

 ankle, podiatrists are in a unique situation in being able to take and interpret radiographs in their own offices.

 Imaging rotation focuses on those skills commonly performed by the podiatrist. This includes positioning and
 developing radiographs along with recognizing the most common pedal pathologies."
