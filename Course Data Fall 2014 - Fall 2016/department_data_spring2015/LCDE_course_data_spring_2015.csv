LCDE 37410 ,"INTRODUCTION TO DISPLAYS AND LIQUID CRYSTAL ELECTRO-OPTICAL DEVICE
",LCDE,"PHY 23101 and PHY 23102, CHEM 10061 and CHEM 10063, MATH 12002 and MATH12003
",None,"TECHNOLOGY
How displays and other electro-optical devices work. The science behind these devices. The principles of
 electro-optical devices, and the challenges to be met by next generation devices. Hands on labs focus on
relevant applications (common LCDs, Bistable Cholesteric displays, Guest Host Devices, Tunable Optical Filters,
 3D displays)."
LCDE 47410 ,"INTRODUCTION TO DISPLAY MATERIALS
",LCDE,"PHY23101, and PHY 23102, CHEM 10061 and CHEM 10063, and MATH 12002 and MATH 12003
",None,"Materials used in optical displays and devices. It includes an introduction to liquid crystal phases, structure-
physical property relationships (dielectric anisotropy, optical birefringence, viscoelastic, switching voltage, etc.)
 among liquid crystals, polymers, alignment materials, optical films and photolithography."
LCDE 47450 ,"CLEANROOM TECHNIQUES AND LIQUID CRYSTAL DEVICE FABRICATION
",LCDE,"MATH 12002 and MATH 12003; CHEM 10060 and CHEM 10063;PHY 23101 and PHY 23102.
",None,"Processes and production methods used for liquid crystal devices. Merges the motivation for a process (what it
 needs to do) with the available techniques (particular processes) to allow students to be able to select the best
 production method and processes for a particular device. The course makes extensive use of the production
 equipment available at the LCI."
LCDE 47560 ,"FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS: MANUFACTURING, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
",LCDE,"PHY 23101 and PHY 23102; CHEM 10061 and CHEM 10063, and MATH 12002and MATH 12003; and special approval.
",None,"The fundamental of sciences behind each display manufacturing technology: LCDs, OLEDs and FEDs. A
 comparative analysis of the different displays and manufacturing technologies in which detailed overviews of
 each technology are linked together so as to provide a comprehensive reference for students and display
 engineers, alike."
